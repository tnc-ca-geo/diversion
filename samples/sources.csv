TNC,"The Nature Conservancy, California",The Nature Conservancy is collaborating with Conservation Farms and Ranches to measure water diversion to comply with the SB88 regulations enforced by the California State Water Resources Control Board.,https://www.nature.org,Kirk Klausmeyer,510-684-4538,kklausmeyer@tnc.org,"201 Mission Street, 4th Floor",San Francisco,CA,94105,"The Nature Conservancy, California. 2017. Water Diversion Measurements on Staten Island, California.",inlandWaters,"Water Diversion Measurements on Staten Island, California","The mission of The Nature Conservancy is to protect the land and waters on which all life depends.  In California, The Nature Conservancy has a goal to ensure nature has water when and where it needs it.  Diverting too much water at the wrong place and the wrong time can harm native freshwater species.  Accurately measuring and reporting water diversions can help identify problem areas and opportunities for changes to reduce the impacts on threatened freshwater species.  The Nature Conservancy owns Staten Island and partners with Conservation Farms and Ranches to grow crops and provide habitat for migratory birds like the Sandhill Crane.  To do this, Conservation Farms and Ranches diverts water throughout the year.  The Nature Conservancy and Conservation Farms are Ranches are committed to accurate measurement and reporting of these water diversions, and to share the lessons learned with other water diverters statewide.  We have created the StatenX Experimental Siphon to test multiple water measurement and reporting technologies. We are sharing the data publicly to help others assess the best and most cost effective water measurement devices to support better conservation outcomes for freshwater species across California.
